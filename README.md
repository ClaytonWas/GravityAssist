# Gravity Assist

An interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js and Next.js. Explore orbital mechanics, launch probes, and learn about planets through hands-on experimentation.

## Features

- **Interactive Solar System** - Accurate planetary data with real orbital mechanics
- **Probe Launcher** - Launch probes from Earth with trajectory prediction
- **Gravity Assists** - Use planetary gravity to redirect probes
- **Planet Info** - Click planets to learn about their properties and composition
- **Multiple Modes** - Solar System, Three Body Problem, and Outer Wilds systems
